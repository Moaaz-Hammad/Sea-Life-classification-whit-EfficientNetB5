# 🌊 Sea Life Buddy: Marine Life Classifier

Welcome to Sea Life Buddy! This is an exciting project that helps identify different types of marine life from images. Think of it as your personal marine biology assistant! 🐠

## ✨ What Can It Do?

Our friendly AI can recognize seven amazing sea creatures:
- 🐟 Grouper - The gentle giants of the reef
- 🐟 Jack - Swift and silvery swimmers
- 🎨 Parrot Fish - Nature's most colorful reef cleaners
- 🦈 Shark - The majestic guardians of the ocean
- 🐡 Snapper - The reef's favorite residents
- 🐠 Surgeon Fish - Like Dory from Finding Nemo!
- 🐟 Tuna - The ocean's lightning-fast swimmers

## 🎯 How Well Does It Work?

Great news! Our marine life buddy is really good at its job:
- Gets it right 96% of the time
- Almost never confuses sharks with other fish
- Super reliable with tuna identification
- Really good at spotting different types of tropical fish

## 🌟 Why It's Special

- Easy to use - just show it a picture!
- Works quickly and accurately
- Uses advanced AI technology (like the kind used by leading tech companies)
- Perfect for marine biology enthusiasts, students, and researchers

## 🎓 How We Built It

We used some really cool technology called EfficientNetB5 (imagine it as a super-smart brain that's been trained to recognize patterns in images), and then taught it all about different types of sea life. It's like teaching a child to recognize different animals, but with computers!

## 📱 How to Use It

1. Take a picture of a fish you want to identify
2. Upload it to our system
3. Get your result in seconds!

It's that simple!
