Steps:
1-Import tensorflow==2.9.1
2-Import system libs 
3-Import data handling tools
4-Import Deep Learning Libraries
5-Data Preprocessing
6-Read data and store it in a data frame
7-Create an image data generator
8-Show sample from train data
9-Model Structure
10-Generic Model Creation
11-Train model
12-Fine-Tuning
13-Unfreeze some layers for fine-tuning
14-Display model performance
15-Evaluate model
16-Get Predictions
17-Confusion Matrics and Classification Report

In these steps, TensorFlow is imported, and system libraries and data handling tools are included. Deep learning libraries, such as Keras, are imported for model creation. Data preprocessing involves normalization and augmentation. The dataset is read into a data frame, and an image data generator is created. Samples from the training data are displayed. The model structure is defined, a generic model is created, and training begins. Fine-tuning involves adjusting hyperparameters. Some layers are unfrozen for fine-tuning. Model performance is displayed during training, and the model is evaluated on a separate dataset. Predictions are obtained, and a confusion matrix and classification report analyze the model's performance.
